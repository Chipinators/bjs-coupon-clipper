To Use:

1) Copy code from clipper.js
2) In your browser add a new bookmark
3) In the Bookmark Added popup click the "More" button
4) Name the bookmark something memorable. Ex "BJs Coupon Clipper"
5) In URL field paste the JavaScript code
6) Login to BJs.com and navigate to "https://www.bjs.com/myCoupons"
7) Click on the newly created bookmark to run the script and auto clip coupons! 

Notes:
- Not a perfect script and doesn't really handle errors
- Sometimes BJs won't load all coupons. After the clipper finished refresh the page and there may be more to clip. Keep doing this until there are no more coupons.
